   </h2>
   <p class="article__content">
    At the 2025 annual meeting of the American Historical Association, a
    <a href="https://www.historians.org/perspectives-article/resolution-for-consideration-at-the-january-2025-business-meeting/">
     resolution
    </a>
    was proposed to oppose scholasticide in Gaza. The AHA membership voted overwhelmingly in favor of the resolution at the annual business meeting; however, the decision was subsequently
    <a href="https://www.historians.org/news/business-meeting-resolution-update/">
     overruled by the AHA's council
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p class="article__content">
    In response, the Executive Committee of the World History Association proposed to the WHA's Council in our January council meeting to propose a similar resolution to our own membership. The council voted to put the resolution to a vote of our own membership. According to Roberts rules, if the resolution passes with a majority of votes from the participating members then the WHA will release a public statement.

    Proposed WHA Resolution
   </h2>
   <p class="article__content">
    Whereas the American Historical Association Council on January 17, 2025 vetoed the Resolution to Oppose Scholasticide in Gaza despite its affirmation by more than 80% of the attendees at the AHA Business Meeting on January 5, 2025; and
   </p>
   <p class="article__content">
    Whereas the extensively documented expulsion and murder of historians, librarians, archivists, teachers, and students, and the destruction of schools, libraries, and archives in Gaza, as detailed in Resolution to Oppose Scholasticide in Gaza, is a matter of concern for all historians; and
   </p>
   <p class="article__content">
    Whereas the mission of the World History Association, an affiliated society of the American Historical Association, is to &ldquo;promote activities which will increase historical awareness, understanding among and between peoples and global consciousness;&rdquo; and
   </p>
   <p class="article__content">
    Whereas these activities are impossible under conditions of scholasticide in Gaza; and
   </p>
   <p class="article__content">
    Whereas this is an egregious instance of restrictions on history education and historical documentation worldwide; and
   </p>
   <p class="article__content">
    Whereas we support transparent and democratic decision making within the historical profession and efforts to bring attention to the obliteration of historical documents, material culture, and the historical profession;
   </p>
   <p class="article__content">
    Therefore be it resolved that the World History Association adopts a version of the American Historical Association&rsquo;s Resolution to Oppose Scholasticide in Gaza as detailed in the following three clauses.
   </p>
   <p class="article__content">
    Be it further resolved that the WHA supports the right of all peoples to freely teach and learn about their past and condemns the Israeli violence in Gaza that undermines that right; and
   </p>
   <p class="article__content">
    Be it further resolved that the WHA calls for a lasting halt to the scholasticide documented in the AHA resolution, which is ongoing despite the current ceasefire; and
   </p>
   <p class="article__content">
    Be it further resolved that the WHA will liaise with
    <a href="https://linktr.ee/historians4palestine">
     Historians for Palestine
    </a>
    and
    <a href="https://librarianswithpalestine.org/">
     Librarians and Archivists with Palestine
    </a>
    to identify opportunities to support the rebuilding of Gaza&rsquo;s educational infrastructure.
   </p>
   <p class="article__content">
    Finally, be it resolved that the WHA calls upon the American Historical Association and its affiliates to adopt their own versions of this resolution.
