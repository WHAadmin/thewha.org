    </abbr>
    members interested in the state and future of the association. At the business meetings, actions taken at the recent Council meeting are announced, and the Executive Director, President, Treasurer, and other officers, council members, and committee chairs report on issues affecting the association, including budget decisions, cost/profit results and projections, and significant goals and problems. Just as important, the questions and advice of all members in attendance are solicited and recorded. In essence, the business meetings are open forums, and

    members should consider active attendance at them to be a duty of membership.
