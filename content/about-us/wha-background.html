    In the United States, world history emerged in the 1970s, a field created by historians and teachers who wanted to move away from an emphasis on national and regional histories toward broader cross-cultural, comparative, and global approaches. Some of these pioneering world historians were trained in area studies programs that focused on regions beyond Europe and the
    <abbr title="United States">
     U.S.
    </abbr>
    ; some were self-taught. They all carried out research and laid theoretical groundwork for the field. Dissatisfied with the scope of most history courses at the secondary and university level, they created world history courses that emphasized connections, comparisons, and large-scale processes. In the early 1980s, a group of these instructors and scholars formed the
    <abbr title="World History Association">
     WHA
    </abbr>
    , set up a governance structure, began to hold meetings, and established ways to share scholarship and ideas, including a newsletter, which later grew into the
    <em>
     World History Bulletin.
    </em>
    They planned a journal, the
    <em>
     Journal of World History,
    </em>
    which saw its first issue in 1990, under the editorship of Jerry Bentley at the University of Hawai&lsquo;i. He remained its editor until his death in 2012. Meetings turned into a regular conference that has been held annually since 1992. Membership grew and regional affiliates were formed in various parts of the country, holding their own conferences and meetings.
