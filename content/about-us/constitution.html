      <li>
       The Association hereby agrees to hold harmless and indemnify each of its Officers, Council members, employees and agents (the &ldquo;Indemnitee&rdquo;) from and against, and to reimburse the Indemnitee for, any and all judgments, fines, liabilities, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable expenses, including attorneys&rsquo; fees actually and necessarily incurred, as a result of or in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, other than one by or in the right of the Association to procure a judgment in its favor, including an action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of any other corporation of any type or kind, domestic or foreign, or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise for which the Indemnitee served in any capacity at the request of the Association, to which the Indemnitee is, was or at any time becomes a party, or is threatened to be made a party, or as a result of or in connection with any appeal therein, by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is, was or at any time becomes an Officer or Council member of the Association, or is or was serving or at any time serves such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise in any capacity, whether arising out of any breach of the Indemnitee&rsquo;s fiduciary duty as an Officer, employee or agent of such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise under any state or federal law or otherwise; provided, however, that no indemnity pursuant to Section 2 shall be paid by the Association (i) if a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to the Indemnitee establishes that the Indemnitee&rsquo;s acts were committed in bad faith or were the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and were material to the cause of action so adjudicated, or that the Indemnitee personally gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which the Indemnitee was not legally entitled; or (ii) if a final judgment by a court having jurisdiction in the matter shall determine that such indemnification is not lawful. The termination of any such civil or criminal action or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create any presumption that the Indemnitee acted in bad faith and/or was dishonest.
      </li>
      <li>
       The obligation of the Association to indemnify contained herein shall continue during the period the Indemnitee serves as an Officer, Council member, employee or agent of the Association and shall continue thereafter so long as the Indemnitee shall be subject to any possible claim or threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee was an Officer of the Association or served at the request of the Association in any capacity for any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise.
      </li>
      <li>
       Promptly after receipt by the Indemnitee of notice of the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding, the Indemnitee will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Association, notify the Association of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the Association will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to the Indemnitee otherwise than under this Section. With respect to any such action, suit or proceeding as to which the Indemnitee notifies the Association of the commencement thereof:
      </li>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The Association will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense; and,Except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this subpart, to the extent that it may wish, the Association jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified will be entitled to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnitee. After notice from the Association to the Indemnitee of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the Association will not be liable to the Indemnitee under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation or as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this subpart. The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ Indemnitee&rsquo;s own counsel in such action, suit or proceeding but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Association of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee unless (A) the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by the Association in connection with the defense of such action, (B) the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Association and the Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action, or (C) the Association shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for the Indemnitee shall be borne by the Association (it being understood, however, that the Association shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one counsel for the Indemnitee in connection with any action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances). The Association shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any action, suit or proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Association or as to which the Indemnitee shall have made the conclusion provided for in clause (B) of the preceding sentence of this subpart.
