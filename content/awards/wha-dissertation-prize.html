        2024 Dissertation Prize Winner
       </h2>
       <p>
        Congratulations to our 2024 Dissertation Prize winner, <b>Jian Gao,</b> for “Crossing Borders, Creating Networks: Chinese Mexicans’ Journeys of Longing and Belonging, 1900s-1950s” – This dissertation is a timely study of transnational migration, focusing on the experiences of Chinese migrants in Mexico in the early twentieth century. It presents an impressive and innovative investigation of archival sources, with research in Chinese, Spanish, and English archives. The extensive use of Chinese sources, both published and unpublished, gives a special strength to this analysis, providing deep insights into the lives of the immigrants themselves. Rather than relying on sources by anti-Chinese activists, this work centers the voices and emotions of Chinese migrants in response to anti-Chinese hostility and racialized violence. It is an important contribution to the growing field of Pacific studies and also to the field of global migration studies. It shows how Chinese migrants created transnational/ transpacific communities connecting China, Mexico, and the United States. This study provides important insights into the nature of movements of migratory peoples in modern world history. This work has the potential to change the way that historians approach the topic of Chinese migration to North America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
