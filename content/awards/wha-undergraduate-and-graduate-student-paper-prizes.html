     Phi Alpha Theta

    A world history paper is one that examines any historical issue with global implications. Such studies can include, but are not limited to, the exchange and interchange of cultures, the comparison of two or more civilizations or cultures, or the study in a macrohistorical manner of a phenomenon that had a global impact. For example, world history topics might include a study of the trans-cultural impact of Eurasia&rsquo;s Silk Road; a comparative study of the Ottoman and British empires; or the worldwide impact of the Influenza Pandemic of 1918.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Committee will judge papers according to the following criteria: world historical scope; originality of research; depth of analysis; and prose style.
