    <strong>
     Jian Gao,
    </strong>
    a doctoral candidate in history at the University of Texas in
      Austin won this year&rsquo;s WHA&ndash;Phi Alpha Theta Best Graduate paper prize. &ldquo;Political Mobilizations and Cultural
      Spaces: Transnational Chinese Associations in Mexico, 1922-1945&rdquo; is an insightful analysis of the work done by
      Chinese associations in Mexico. The paper ties Tong brotherhoods to the exercise of politics in China and other
      parts of the world, making it a thoroughly global paper. It also dispels the traditional assumption that Tongs
      were only violent criminal underworld organizations, providing strong evidence that points instead to their role
      as transnational community and political organizations supporting movements in China. Gao&rsquo;s work uses both Chinese
      and Spanish language sources, a move at the forefront of an emerging strand of both global and Latin American
      studies. Another of his papers received recognition from the Rocky Mountain Council for Latin American Studies,
      the oldest Latin-American focused academic organization in the world, and his dissertation research won support
      from the American Historical Association&rsquo;s Bernadotte E. Schmidt grant.

    <strong>
     Alan Strathern,
    </strong>
    an associate professor at Brasenose College, Oxford University, is an early
      modernist with a deep interest in religious conversion. His book,

    </em>
    :
    <em>
     Religious and Political Change in World History
    </em>
    (Cambridge University Press, 2019)
      won the 2020 Jerry Bentley Prize for the best book in world history. His magisterial account highlights the
      interplay between religion and political authority that characterized states and societies in many world regions
      prior to the twentieth century. His rich theoretical and empirical study demonstrates how and why both immanentist
      and transcendentalist traditions were crucial to the construction of states, political power, and legitimacy. The
      book ranges far and wide across space and time to trace the political entanglements of Buddhism, Christianity,
      Islam, and the religions of the Pacific Islands. He is at work on a comparative study of ruler conversions in
      Kongo, Hawai&rsquo;i, Japan, and Thailand.
