    On March 11 the World Health Organisation officially characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic.
      Within days the South African government responded,
    <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/state-of-war-ramaphosa-takes-command-of-covid-19-response-as-national-disaster-is-declared-20200316">
     announcing
        a national state of disaster
    </a>
    and later imposing a
    <a href="https://www.gov.za/coronavirus/guidelines">
     strict
        lockdown
    </a>
    , as part of which&nbsp;most shops and businesses were closed and citizens told to stay at home.
   </p>
   <p>
    The seriousness with which the President and his team are treating the crisis&nbsp;is acknowledged by BBC Africa
      correspondent Andrew Harding who, in a
    <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-52125713">
     recent
        article
    </a>
    , applauds South Africa for its &ldquo;ruthlessly efficient&rdquo; fight against the novel coronavirus. Harding
      argues that largely due to the effective leadership of President Cyril Ramaphosa and Health Minister Dr. Zweli
      Mkhize the country has moved to contain the pandemic faster and more firmly than many of its international
      counterparts.

    Yet, while the overall picture is quite positive, it is important to recognize the considerable challenges still
      confronting this much divided country, many of which threaten to undermine the good work that is being done.
      Twenty-six years after the end of apartheid, South Africa remains
    <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/gini-coefficient-by-country/">
     one of the most divided
        countries in the world
    </a>
    . In Johannesburg, the country&rsquo;s largest city, leafy suburbs and gated communities
      stand alongside sprawling informal townships.

    I am a white postgraduate student. In middle-class suburbia where I live not that much has changed in past weeks.
      In our three bedroom house, my family and I have been able work from home and maintain a safe social distance with
      relative ease. Our fridge and pantry are well stocked, and, although it has been frustrating not being allowed out
      for a morning jog, our garden provides ample space for exercise and other time spent outdoors.

    Just a few kilometres away, in the Township of Alexandra, the picture looks very different. First established in
      1912, Alexandra is one of the city&rsquo;s most densely populated areas. Its infrastructure was designed for population
      of 70,000 but it currently houses more than double this number, with entire families residing in what are termed
      &ldquo;backyard shacks.&rdquo; Access to water and sanitation is extremely limited. In such an environment the virus could
      spread very quickly.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, in Alexandra and in many other townships, the government is struggling to enforce social distancing.
      Partly, this is because, to quote journalist
    <a href="https://www.tommytrenchard.com/">
     Tommy Trenchard,
    </a>
    for
      many township residents &ldquo;fear of the virus is being outstripped by the fear of running out of money.&rdquo; (Trenchard&rsquo;s
      reporting for NPR include stunning images of

    .) Whilst driving to the supermarket I encounter a beggar. &ldquo;Please madam, I need money
      for food but the police are saying we must stay at home,&rdquo; he explains. Like many of his co-residents,

    There has long been a close relationship between disease and social division in South Africa. In fact, the first
      forced evictions of black Africans from Cape Town and Johannesburg occurred as a result of plagues in the early
      20th century, with the white middle-class emphasising the &ldquo;health risks&rdquo; posed by a growing black urban class. But
      while the current pandemic has highlighted existing inequalities, it does also offer real opportunities for unity
      and social change. It is crucial that in their response to this crisis government and civil society take full
      advantage of these opportunities.
