    Thanks to everyone who participated in this week&rsquo;s third
    <strong>
     Under the
        Baobab
    </strong>
    session:
    <em>
     Reframing Revolutions: Centering Indigenous, Black, and Women&rsquo;s Voices in the Age
        of Revolutions
    </em>
    . Angela Lee, Eric Beckman and Bram Hubbell restructured the workshop they had planned for
      the WHA&rsquo;s 2020 annual meeting, adapting it to our new Zoom reality.

    As a teacher, I appreciate the ways in which they focused our attention on learning outcomes for the session
      (center women and people of color in narratives that are too often replicated as world changing because of the
      actions of white men) and adapted their presentation from in-person to online delivery, including
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ScGOuBa_43hlcZIF18aPVAzeivKPCaiC80jUjJKQBmM/edit?usp=sharing">
     primary
        sources to support each presentation
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    As an administrator, I appreciate their initiative to create programming that addresses the urgent political
      climate of the United States and supports teachers at all levels as we grapple with delivering a quality
      educational experience online. (If our students were all as eager to learn world history as the participants in
      Tuesday&rsquo;s workshop were, then the prevalence of distance instruction would not be sending teachers around the
      world into a tailspin.)

    The WHA staff is working to get the recording of the plenary parts of the workshop edited and posted online as a
      resource for those who couldn&rsquo;t attend. A lot of the magic happened in breakout rooms, which weren&rsquo;t recorded. We
      do, however, have

     notes
        from the breakout rooms.
