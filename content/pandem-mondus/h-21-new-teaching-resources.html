    Have you been re-thinking how you teach world history? Did you rise to the challenge of our times by opening a new portal to the past for your students, one that also helps them acquire the skills that only the study of world history can teach them? Is there something you have been working on for years, or a fresh new idea that you&rsquo;re really proud of?
   </p>
   <p>
    Here&rsquo;s your chance to publish your ideas as part of&nbsp;History for the 21
    <sup>
     st
    </sup>
    Century&nbsp;(&ldquo;H/21&rdquo;), a collaborative project that takes a fresh look at introductory college history courses. The project is supported by a grant from a civic-minded history alumnus at San Francisco State University, and managed by an independent editorial board of historians.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re starting with world history courses; and our collection is called &ldquo;Our World in Time.&rdquo;
   </p>
   <p>
    H/21 is commissioning dozens of teaching modules that will be peer-reviewed and &ldquo;test-driven&rdquo; in classes before being finalized. Published modules will be available to all instructors and their students at no charge as Open Educational Resources under a creative commons license. We&rsquo;re looking for modules that are inquiry based, and that combine important and innovative perspectives, engaging materials, a focus on the skills that underpin the work of historical writing and analysis, and well-considered assessments of students&rsquo; work. Modules will usually encompass two days to two weeks of class work and may be &ldquo;dropped-in&rdquo; to existing courses or combined with other materials in new course designs. Authors will be compensated.

     This module will ask students to find an answer for the following question: How did the Han dynasty manage to impose a stable, unified, centrally administered empire over a geographically vast and culturally diverse area?&nbsp; Students will first survey the political and cultural landscape of the early Chinese world to gain an appreciation of the challenges any would-be empire might face.&nbsp; Then, students will split into groups to examine sources from a single region or topic of interest in the Han (such as crime and punishment).
