    Juneteenth started local, the day celebrated by formerly enslaved people in Texas as they
      started their lives as freed people. June 19, 1865 was two and half years after President Abraham Lincoln declared
      the emancipation of slaves in the United States and two months after the formal end of the Civil War fought over
      that proclamation. It took a Union Army General, Gordon Granger, saying plainly and unequivocally that power
      relationships between masters and servants were indelibly altered in order for the reality of a new freedom to
      resonate in Galveston and beyond. Two and a half centuries of violent subordination were not, however, undone by a
      single act or proclamation. Not the British naval enforcement of the abolition of the slave trade in 1806. Not the
      Emancipation Proclamation. Not a bloody Civil War. And, tragically, not by the celebrations of

    , as the holiday is sometimes called,
      in the nineteenth, twentieth, or twenty-first centuries.

    Juneteenth 2020 is a stark reminder of the global persistence of racism, inequality, and pernicious anti-Black
      racism,&nbsp; more than a century and a half after Black Texans started celebrating June nineteenth as Freedom Day or
      Liberation Day. Memories of slavery and celebrations of freedom moved with migrants, survived Reconstruction and
      Jim Crow, touched the Harlem Renaissance and Chicago&rsquo;s South Side, but never existed in a space where Black
      Americans were truly free:
    <em>
     free from
    </em>
    fear, persecution, or racism;
    <em>
     free to
    </em>
    work, worship, live,
      or love as they pleased.

    Juneteenth is an American story, but it clearly resonates globally this year. In the past three weeks we have
      witnessed demonstrations in support of the US

    movement on every continent except Antarctica. Protesters responded with anger and horror to a White
      police officer killing George Floyd in public in Minneapolis. The worldwide outrage is deeper and more intimate
      than solidarity with Black Americans, though. In Brussels, London, Bristol, Nairobi, Johannesburg, Rio de Janeiro,
      Sydney, and Seoul, crowds in the street risked Coronavirus exposure not just to mourn George Floyd, but
      to
    <strong>
     demand a reconsideration of the connections between violence, racism, and the state
    </strong>
    in their
      own countries.

   <p>
    On Juneteenth, on behalf of our diverse membership, the officers of the WHA express our solidarity with the
      global protest movement in defense of the lives and dignity of all Black people. We recognize the role of systemic
      racism in the institutions where we teach, the cities where we live, and the communities we study. We pledge to
      work for a world in which we can celebrate Juneteenth as a historical step toward genuine liberation.
