      petroleum and energy history, and he is the author or editor of several books, including:
    <em>
     Petrolia: The
        Landscape of American&rsquo;s First Oil Boom

    (THHN). &nbsp;Black&rsquo;s articles have appeared in the
    <em>
     Journal of American History
    </em>
    ,

     Environmental History, USA Today
    </em>
    , and the
    <em>

      His comments will tie these larger efforts to the regional stories of western Pennsylvania, birthplace of the
      American oil industry.

    Victor Seow is a historian of technology, science and industry, specializing in China and Japan in global
      contexts and in histories of energy and work.&nbsp; His first book,
    <em>
     Carbon Technocracy: Energy Regimes in Modern
        East Asia
    </em>
    (Chicago, 2021), uses the history of what was once East Asia&rsquo;s largest coal mine to explore the
      rise of the fossil fuel economy and the technocratic state in China and Japan and more generally, the
      relationships between energy and power in the industrial modern age.&nbsp; He is currently writing a new book on
      industrial psychology as a science of work and a technology of production in China.
