    The WHA invites applicants to apply for the World Scholar Travel Fellowship. &nbsp;This fund enables the primary recipient to attend with round-trip air fare and conference registration paid by the WHA.&nbsp; Additional funding may or may not be available; that will be determined at a later date.&nbsp; If there is a secondary recipient, the WHA will fund their registration and conference accommodations.&nbsp; Priority is given to conference attendees residing outside North America who do not have travel funding from their home institutions.&nbsp; All possible attempts at securing other funding should be made prior to applying for the fellowship.
   </p>
   <p class="article__content">
    The World Scholar Travel Fellowship is offered on a competitive basis.&nbsp; Eligibility for the fellowship is based on acceptance by the Conference Program Committee of an individual paper, whether or not part of an organized panel, or a poster for the poster session.&nbsp; No person who has received a travel fellowship in a previous year may apply for another fellowship.&nbsp; Applicants must be willing to apply for and finance their own visas to the conference site.
