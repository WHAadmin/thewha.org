     From June 22-June 24, 2023, the World History Association, in partnership with the University of Pittsburgh&rsquo;s World History Center, will be holding our 32nd Annual Meeting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As one of the earliest developers of coal and oil energy and home to one of the country&rsquo;s top World History programs, the &ldquo;Steel City&rdquo; is the perfect locale for the Meeting&rsquo;s overarching theme, ENERGIES, where scholars from across the globe will have the opportunity to present new and innovative research on a vast array of energy-related topics. In addition to a weekend of stimulating intellectual pursuits, participants will also be treated to an Opening Reception at the historic Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, complete with 23 distinctive gardens spread across 15 acres just a few miles from the very heart of downtown Pittsburgh. For more information on this stunning architectural and botanical marvel, please visit
