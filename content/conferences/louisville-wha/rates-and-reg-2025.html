    Louisville 2025 Rates and Registration
   </h1>
   <p class="article__content">
    Given the rising cost of running the conference and feedback from members and conference attendees, the WHA Council has voted to modify our registration process and rates for 2025. In the past, we have had member and nonmember pricing as well as individual discounted registration rates for students, k-14 teachers, and online only attendance with Early, Regular, and Late rates for each of those categories. This year, we've decided to streamline the registration rates to only three categories: Regular registration, Discounted Registration, and the OER Project Sponsored free registration for k-12 teachers from KY, TN, OH, and IN. The rates for nonmember registration, in practice, were roughly equivalent to the member registration rate + the cost of a membership, so we are now making membership a requirement for Regular Registration and Discounted Registration and the discounted registration now encompasses students, online only attendees, middle school, high school, and community college instructors. We've also limited it to Early and Late Registration.
