     Lodging

    We are finalizing our contract with FSFU for lodging in their residence halls during the conference.

     We will have more details and a portal to reserve rooms up shortly.

    All beds are twin XL. The difference between doubles and singles is the occupant in the room. There will be times where someone requests a single in a bedroom with two beds. The guest suites are junior one bedroom apartments, a little larger than a studio for one person or a couple sharing a unit.
   </p>
   <p class="article__content">
    * Rates below are preliminary (for attendees who need to apply for funding), per person, per bed, per night. There will be a one time charge of $30.25 for Linen Services. These prices include full breakfast and lunch.
