It is devoted to the study of phenomena that transcend the boundaries of single states, regions, or cultures, such as large-scale population movements, long-distance trade, cross-cultural technology transfers, and the global spread of ideas. It engages with the historiographical, theoretical, and methodological approaches to world history, conceived broadly. Along with individual articles based on original research,

    <i>
     World History Bulletin
    </i>
    is seeking quality research essays, experiential learning case studies, and classroom activities for inclusion in its upcoming Spring/Summer 2025 issue, &ldquo;Disappearances and Preservations in World History.&rdquo; The issue will explore how our understanding of the past evolves as we revisit, reconsider, and preserve history for future generations.
   </p>
   <p class="article__content">
    The theme of &ldquo;Disappearances and Preservations&rdquo; raises important questions about who determines what is preserved and what is allowed to disappear, the criteria used to ensure preservation, the motives which inform disappearance or preservation, the evolution of techniques of preservation, the affect of the loss of historical material on future studies, and how selective
preservation can prejudice current historical studies.
   </p>
   <p class="article__content">
    The
    <i>
     Bulletin
    </i>
    is interested in submissions covering a range of topics related to the theme of disappearances and preservations, including:
   </p>
   <ul class="article__content">
    <li>
     Suppressing Histories. Studying the efforts of regimes to erase or suppress histories which contradict official narratives.
    </li>
    <li>
     Preservation of Historical Memory. The exploration of how histories are documented and by whom.
    </li>
    <li>
     Recovering Histories. Examining histories forgotten or &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo; and how they might be recovered.
    </li>
    <li>
     Techniques used in the classroom to introduce and explore disappearances and preservations as part of wider political and sociocultural phenomena.
    </li>
    <li>
     Historiographies of theories and practice concerned with disappearances and preservations in world history.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p class="article__content">
    <i>
     World History Bulletin
    </i>
    therefore invites contributions to a thematic issue on disappearances and preservations in world history. We are especially interested in articles that share novel research or historiographical perspectives which explore the wider economic, sociocultural, and/or political circumstances which result in disappearance or preservation; present innovative/experiential teaching at all levels that employs techniques related to disappearances and preservations in world history; or explore the connection between student engagement and world history as a result of coursework related to the theme &ldquo;disappearances and preservations.&rdquo;

    We also welcome short interviews with designers, artists, writers, and scholars and small roundtables on a book, film, or other work.
