     As a supporter and member of the World History Association, you realize the importance of the organization and its mission. You also realize the importance of a stable financial foundation and may have already considered placing the
     <abbr title="World History Association">
      WHA
     </abbr>
     in your planned giving so that you may have a continuing impact on world history education and research.
    </p>
    <p>
     We currently rely on your help to sustain the
     <abbr title="World History Association">
      WHA
     </abbr>
     through your membership and contributions in the short term, but we also need your help to ensure the long-term viability of the
     <abbr title="World History Association">
      WHA
     </abbr>
     . You have the significant ability to accomplish this through your estate planning as an expression of your vision and your commitment to world history. While your bequest will not affect your financial situation during your lifetime, your gift will provide an important legacy to ensure the continued success of the
     <abbr title="World History Association">
      WHA
     </abbr>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Some common ways to include the
     <abbr title="World History Association">
      WHA
     </abbr>
     in your planned giving in your will or trust include a gift as a percentage of your total estate, a specific dollar amount, or specific gifts (cash, stocks, bonds,
     <abbr title="individual retirement account">
      IRA
     </abbr>
     s, life insurance, royalty income, charitable gift annuity, charitable trust annuity, remainder annuity, remainder trust, or property).
    </p>
    <p>
     Unrestricted gifts are the most flexible for the
     <abbr title="World History Association">
      WHA
     </abbr>
     . Most chose to name the
     <abbr title="World History Association">
      WHA
     </abbr>
     as a direct beneficiary in a bequest, but some may name the
     <abbr title="World History Association">
      WHA
     </abbr>
     as a residual estate beneficiary or as a contingency beneficiary, after other specific desires are provided for. Certain gifts have more significant tax advantages, while others can provide a lifetime of retirement income for you, which then continue on to the
     <abbr title="World History Association">
      WHA
     </abbr>
     in the future. Consulting your estate attorney and letting him or her know your wishes is the first step&mdash;the vehicle chosen will depend upon your individual desires.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many sample bequest forms can be easily found online or at your local library, but your financial advisor or attorney is best equipped to assist you in the specific planning of any gifts and to ensure your wishes are correctly carried out. If you have already prepared your will or trust, you may simply add to it to make a gift to the
     <abbr title="World History Association">
      WHA
     </abbr>
     through a codicil or an amendment.
