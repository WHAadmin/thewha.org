    Through the generosity of WHA members and friends, we were able to offer scholars in need the opportunity to benefit from the resources and the connections which a membership to the WHA provides.
   </p>
   <p class="article__content">
    We believe that all scholars of world history should have the opportunity to be a part of our community and access to valuable sources of scholarship.

     You can embody the spirits of collegiality and generosity by directly funding fellow scholar&rsquo;s membership to the WHA.
