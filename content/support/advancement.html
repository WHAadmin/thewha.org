    Each November the WHA participates in GivingTuesday, our end-of-year giving campaign. The three areas of focus for 2023 are: Scholarships, the General Fund, and the Endowment.

     In recognition of this support, all members who give during the period of November 28 through December 22, 2023 will be listed in the World History Bulletin.
