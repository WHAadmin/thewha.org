     New Tech Stack Launches!
    </h1>
    <p class="article__content">
     The WHA is excited to announce the launch of our new website. While visually similar, this website is static, lightweight, and built on Open Source technology! This means that it places a lower burden on our operational budget and we have more control and agency to resolve problems when they arise than we did with our previous platform. It is also less vulnerable to security breaches than our former dynamic sites.
