     New Tech Stack Launches!
    </h1>
    <p class="article__content">
     The WHA is excited to announce the launch of our new website. While visually similar, this website is static, lightweight, and Open Source! This means that it places a lower burden on our operational budget and we have more control and agency to resolve problems when they arise than we did with our previous platform. It is also less vulnerable to security breaches than our former dynamic sites.

    <p class="article__content">
     We've also just launched our new membership database through YourMembership. To login for the first time, please use the email address associated with your WHA account and
