    The non-binding theme for this year&rsquo;s conference is &ldquo;Water in World History.&rdquo; We invite participants to consider how water has shaped history on our blue planet from ancient times to the present. Papers might examine water as a substance, a natural resource, a habitat, or an agent of ecological change. Presenters could discuss historical human engagement with wetlands, lakes and rivers, oceans, or marine locales. Other suitable topics include maritime cultures and communities, mentalities or beliefs, overseas trade or migrations, shipwrecks, maritime law, marine industries, or the built marine environment. Topics concerning the historiography or public history of water are encouraged. As always, SEWHA also welcomes proposals about other regions, peoples, and questions in world history.
