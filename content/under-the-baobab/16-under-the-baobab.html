    This will be a working Baobab divided into 1/3 segments for the 1.5 hours.&nbsp; The goal is to develop a model
      curriculum for high school teachers that is approved by the WHA.&nbsp; It will be a roadmap to one of the ways that
      World History can be currently taught. Additionally, all high school educators and WHA members attend free of
      charge.
   </p>
   <p>
    The first half hour, Dr. Brittiani McNeil (Ed.D. specialist in assessment) will describe ways we can support high
      quality world history education in government standards and model curricula by engaging with policy makers and
      legislators.&nbsp; During the second half hour, the other three panelists discuss developing practical methods to
      advocate for high-quality history standards (Pamela McVay, Stephen Jackson, Angela Lee).&nbsp; Finally, the last
      portion of the night will be breakout sessions on the feasibility of WHA standards statement on curriculum.
