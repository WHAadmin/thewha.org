    What&rsquo;s the point of taking a history class now? History teachers know that historical thinking skills help
      students evaluate sources and arguments in the past and the present, but communicating that to our students is a
      challenge, particularly now. The sources and strategies shared in this session offer paths to engaging students
      and connecting historical thinking skills to their lived experiences in the context of our new normal.
