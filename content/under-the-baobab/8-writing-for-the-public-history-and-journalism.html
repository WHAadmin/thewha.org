    In this session of Under the Baobab, we think closely about how journalists write history for large audiences. In
      doing so, we examine the use of public history through a number of different media, including print, podcasts,
      webcasts, and more. Our presenters will talk about their own experiences doing history from a journalistic angle,
      before opening a question and answer session moderated by Jack Norton.
