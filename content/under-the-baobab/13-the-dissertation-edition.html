    &ldquo;The Pacific Sailors: Global workers at and on the edge of the Spanish empire (1580s &ndash; 1640s)&rdquo;
   </h4>
   <p class="article__content">
    Kristyl Obispado has completed a remarkable study of 1,500 global sailors in the sixteenth and seventeenth
      centuries, using impressive archival research and data analysis to describe the life experiences of individuals
      who plied Pacific waters and joined the trade that their ships were involved in. Her work combines data analysis
      with close reading and global history including microhistory. Dr. Obispado&rsquo;s work helps to define Pacific history
      as a field in world history.

    &ldquo;Liberated Africans and Law in the South Atlantic, c. 1839 &ndash; 1871&rdquo;
   </h4>
   <p class="article__content">
    Jake Richards&rsquo; dissertation is an impressive study of the treatment and experiences of &ldquo;liberated Africans&rdquo;
      seized by the British navy from slave ships in the decades around the end of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Dr.
      Richards examines records created by courts set up in the New World, Europe and Africa to process liberated
      Africans once the British Naval Squadron deposited them at some port. This is a study of transnational law and the
      institutions and practices that surrounded it, yet it&rsquo;s also a study of what actually happened to liberated
      Africans and as far as it is possible to ascertain, how they themselves thought, felt and acted.

    &ldquo;A Sea of Wealth: Sayyid Sa&rsquo;id bin Sultan, His Omani Empire, and the Making of An Oceanic Marketplace&rdquo;
   </h4>
   <p class="article__content">
    In this dissertation about the Omani Empire and its role in global economic imperial developments in the
      nineteenth century, Nicholas Roberts builds an extraordinary case from widely dispersed archival materials that
      reveal both economic and imperial narratives about the Omani empire. Dr. Roberts has written a dissertation that
      is well-structured, well-researched and well-written and one that demonstrates an awareness of some major problems
      with global history narratives.
