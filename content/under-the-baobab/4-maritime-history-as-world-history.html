    What does maritime history have to do with world history? In
    <em>
     A World at Sea
    </em>
    (Penn Press), a new volume
      edited by Lauren Benton and Nathan Perl-Rosenthal, nine contributors reflect on the promise and prospect of a
      global approach to maritime history. Drawing on social history, history of science, legal history, and many other
      approaches, the authors consider how the study of the sea and seafaring can inform and alter narratives in world
      history and the contributions that a global lens can make to maritime history.
