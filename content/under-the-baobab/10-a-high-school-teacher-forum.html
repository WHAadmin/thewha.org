    Join WHA Council Member Eric Beckman and WHA member Connie Hudgeons, recipient of the WHA 2021 Pioneer in World
      History Award, for an engaging conversation related to current concerns in the secondary school classroom. They
      will focus on Student Engagement Techniques (SET) to develop upper level thinking skills with activities for both
      the classroom as well as virtual environments. Both discussants have a half century of teacher experience
      combined. There will be time for discussion among the participants for active engagement.
