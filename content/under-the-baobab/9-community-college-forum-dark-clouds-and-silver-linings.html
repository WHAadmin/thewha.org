    Join WHA Council Member Alex Holowicki and WHA member Monica Ketchum, both community college faculty, to explore
      two topics current to education at this level: engaging students across modalities and weathering low enrollments
      and unprepared students. There will be time for discussion among the participants for active engagement. Jack
      Norton, Chair of the WHA Community College Committee will make introductions and support additional commentary.
