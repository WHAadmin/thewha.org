    Please join us from 19-22 October 2023 for the annual meeting of SEWHA, the southeastern regional affiliate of
      the World History Association. The conference will be held in face-to-face format only. The Department of History
      at College of Charleston is our generous institutional sponsor for this year&rsquo;s annual conference. Our keynote
      speaker, the esteemed environmental historian John R. McNeill (Georgetown University), appears courtesy of W.W.

      Association.

    The non-binding theme for this year&rsquo;s conference is &ldquo;Water in World History.&rdquo; We invite participants to consider
      how water has shaped history on our blue planet from ancient times to the present. Papers might examine water as a
      substance, a natural resource, a habitat, or an agent of ecological change. Presenters could discuss historical
      human engagement with wetlands, lakes and rivers, oceans, or marine locales. Other suitable topics include
      maritime cultures and communities, mentalities or beliefs, overseas trade or migrations, shipwrecks, maritime law,
      marine industries, or the built marine environment. Topics concerning the historiography or public history of
      water are encouraged. As always, SEWHA also welcomes proposals about other regions, peoples, and questions in
      world history.
   </p>
   <p class="article__content">
    We encourage proposals for individual papers, panels and roundtable discussions, information sessions,
      interactive media presentations, and pedagogical demonstrations in accordance with our mission to advance &ldquo;studies
      of world history through research, teaching, and publication.&rdquo; INDIVIDUAL PROPOSALs should include an abstract
      (250 words maximum), contact information, affiliation, and a current CV. GROUP PROPOSALS should be submitted as a
      single document containing a panel abstract (150 words maximum), brief abstracts for each presenter (150 words),
      the organizer&rsquo;s contact information, and a current CV with affiliation for each presenter, moderator, discussant,
      etc. Sessions are 75 minutes in length, and each session may include three presenters and a chair/moderator. The
